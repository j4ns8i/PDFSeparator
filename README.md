# PDFSeparator
This program separates A3-sized documents into respective A4-sized documents with respect to page orientation, all in the PDF format.

In an office I worked in, I had to scan thousands of files by hand throughout the day, so I decided to make my life easier and speed up the process by writing this program that allowed me to scan whole folders at a time. I would simply alternate the orientation of each multi-page document (first document is landscape, second is portrait, etc.) and put the result into the scanner. It scanned it as an A3 document, which my program splits up into multiple A4 documents by scanning for any ink in certain areas of each page to determine the orientation.
